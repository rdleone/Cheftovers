Stir in the rosemary and garlic. Allow the milk to come to boil, then lower the heat to medium-low. Partially cover with the lid and cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pork and set aside to rest."

Pour the water into the pan, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Slice the pork and serve with the milk sauce."
